My process for extracting card functions was simply to make another class file;
I broke out the functions one by one, determining which parameters needed to be
passed from the original functions, and which ones could be declared inside the
functions. This was made relatively simple by the fact that every single one of
the cases returned at the end, so variables were not shared when cases cascaded
into each other. I styled the function prototypes to improve long-term clarity.
