I decided to do my bugfix on adventurer. Adventurer was experiencing a bug in
which it was occasionally not adding the requisite 2 additional treasure cards
to the hand of the current player.

I was able to identify (using my random tester and bash) a seed at which the
error was known to occur. Then I used GDB to identify the problem. I set a
break point at the beginning of playCard, and stepped through the code,
tracking variables to see where the error was occurring.

Lo and behold, the error was not in fact in adventure, but in my testing
helper functons. When I was setting the number of players, I was choosing from a
range of 0-3 instead of 1-4. This was causing the loop which iterated over the
players to iterate 0 times, meaning that the target card to be tested was never
set in any player's hand. This caused playCard to exit prematurely, and for the
actions of a given card to never be executed.

The principles that were the most pertinent here were 2. Make it fail, and 7.
Check the plug.
