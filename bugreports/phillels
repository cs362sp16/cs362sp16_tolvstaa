1. Adventurer_action has a bug causing the player's hand count to not match the
    amount of treasure drawn at the end of the test.
2. Tests for embargo fail because embargo interacts with coins, and the coins
    implementation has not been changed from the original codebase, and is
    therefore improperly handled across all cards.
3. Sea Hag uses post-decrement instead of pre-decrement, and accidentally post-
    decrements twice instead of using n-1.
